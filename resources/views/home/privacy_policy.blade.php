                        <p>We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to
                            verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
                        <p>Response Timing and Format</p>

                            applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information
                            that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another
                            without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail communication.</p>
                        <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request
                            unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a

                            your request.</p>

                            opt-in") from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age or the parent or guardian of a
                            consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-into Personal Information sales may opt-out of

                        <p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that
                            can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we

                            describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your
                            prior opt-in Consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>
