                            services.</p>
                        <p>Weeshare is a digital marketing platform in which we will have two types of user
                            advertisers and publishers. Advertisers can upload their creatives and content; they can generate content as
                            well (if they don't have one) through an AI content generator implemented on our platform. And then can
                            schedule the time they want their post to go live on social media (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn,
                            and YouTube)</p>
                        <p>Advertisers can also create a survey and ask the publisher to fill out the surveys for
                            them (geolocation age and gender targets). The survey will be an add-on to the subscription. With years of
                            experience and many completed projects, we've helped our clients to gain everything from followers to
                            funding.</p>
